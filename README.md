# senteradev3

The goal of this project is to evaluate the healthiness of plants in a given tuple of pictures. In each tuple there will be one RGB picture and one NIR picture.

## Motivation

The project originates from an idea to use Hololens for plant health detection. The complexity of that idea however, was beyond expectation. The project was thus reduced to a purely computer based evalution of plant health. 

## Technical Challenges

The NDVI index, which is the index used in this project to evaluate healthiness of plants. The NDVI index was used primarily in remote sensing. It's effectiveness in near field sensing was not proven. 

## Technical Solutions

This project applied a neural network to find an optimal function that resembles the NDVI function for near field sensing. 

## Running

python Model1.py
